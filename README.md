This project aims to create a comprehensive English-Japanese glossary for computer science and related fields.

Currently, the repository contains a collection of dozens of *unverified* English-Japanese terms (see [the terms](en-ja-terms.md)). More terms will be added and verified. A TermBase eXchange (TBX) format will also be provided shortly.

## Term source

All terms are from the Internet, including [Qiita](https://qiita.com/) and [はてなブログ](https://hatenablog.com/).
